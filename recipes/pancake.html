    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>150 grams of wheat flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon standard sugar</li>
      <li>225 milliliters of milk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 piece of melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder and sugar. Form a well in
        the center and pour in the milk, then add the eggs and melted butter.
        Beat well until you have a lump-free dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a comal or skillet over medium heat and grease with butter. To make
        sure the pan is hot enough, test with a drop of batter. Pour portions of
        the batter over the hot butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook each hot cake until bubbles begin to form on the surface and the
        edges look dry. Flip and cook on the other side for 1 to 2 minutes,
        until lightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with butter, fruit and bee, maple or agave honey.</li>
